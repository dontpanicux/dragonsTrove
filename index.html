            <h2>The Story of Dragon’s Trove</h2>

            <p>Dragon’s Trove Press was conceived solely to support authors who are writing purely to satisfy a creative desire to write, to share an inspiration they have, a story they want told, but likely do not have aspirations to be a New York Times Bestselling author. There are big commercial publishers for those people. </p>

            <p>Authors who are writing purely out of passion, to check off their bucket list, to stretch their own personal boundaries by doing something new, and will likely self-publish with minimal marketing overhead are the types of authors and content creators Dragon’s Trove has in mind and seeks to support.</p>

                <p>Meet Dr Tricia Carling, a brilliant scientist and contented loner who is satisfied immersing herself in her work and taking life one day at a time. That all changes one day suddenly when an accident embues her with unusual abilities and sets her on a reluctant journey of self-discovery.</p>

                <p>When the activities of a terrorist organization begin to look like something larger and more sinister, Tricia is forced to not only learn the full extent of her new capabilities but to reassess her role in the world and how far she is willing to go to save humanity itself.</p>

                <p>It’s been over a year since Beacon appeared in Crystal Bay and while her impact is generally regarded as a boon to the city, Tricia is skeptical that she’s truly making the difference she had intended. </p>

                <p>Her commitment will be tested though when a set of mysterious disappearances thrusts her into the center of a conspiracy that forces her to more closely examine the source of her powers and prevent nefarious forces at work from using them to threaten the very world she’s sworn to protect.</p>

            <h3>Our Master of Scribe, Jeffrey Hallett</h3>
            <p>Jeff is originally from upstate New York and has been an enthusiastic follower of science fiction, superhero, and fantasy literature, comics, shows, and movies from his early childhood. After a short stint in Wisconsin, Jeff has settled in Northern California where his career has focused on high-technology product development and, more recently, consulting on organizational and team transformation.</p>
            
            <p>In his writing and his work, Jeff draws inspiration from the human condition and how we all can help each other embrace our strengths, learn from life’s opportunities, and become the best versions of ourselves. </p>
            
            <p>Jeff also enjoys music, do-it-yourself projects, and experiencing outdoors through hiking and other activities; watching the sun rise from the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro was one of his personal defining experiences.</p>
